Just map for 10 minutes, or until 220 nodes are discovered

mapping: 
    1st config:
        tiles = 206
        time = 600
        score = 59.3
    
    shorter time
    2nd config:
        tiles = 132
        time = 338
        score = 44.6

    3d config:
        tiles = 241
        time = 660
        score = 66
^^^^^^^^
Use, 3d config with 252 nodes to explore
with a time cap of 14 minutes
stop the simulation whenever backtracking is not efficient.


A faster circle speed may not increment the speed in a meaningful way
fastest run:

    worst config (but safe):
        crm speed = 1.5
        time = 312.29
        score = 48.2

    base config:
        crm speed = 2.0
        time = 259.1
        score = 57

    1st config:
        crm speed = 2.5
        time = 225.7
        score = 62.3

    2nd config:
        crm speed = 2.7
        time = 217.7
        score = 63.8
